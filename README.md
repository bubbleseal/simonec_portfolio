Welcome to Simone Chong's github repository!

www.simonec.net is an e-porfolio made by Simone Chong to showcase her skills and projects done since she delved into the web development field. There consists a few folders in this repository. 
Each folder represents one of each project that I have worked on and they hold the source files inside.
